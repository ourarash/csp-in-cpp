Course Description
This course teaches students how to use C++ as a professional developer in industry would. We will explore
several different areas and applications where C++ sees significant use. We will learn applications of
advanced concepts including lambda expressions, templates, secure coding, parallel programming, writing
performant code, CMake, and continuous integration.
Learning Objectives
Write C++ code for programming assignments in several different real-life applications
Refine student’s ability to design and write high-quality C++ code
Learn how to improve the performance of C++ code
Learn how to apply new programming paradigms (such as functional and data-oriented
programming)
Learn new ways to apply previously-known C++ language constructs
Learn how the C++ language has evolved in the C++11, 14, and 17 standards, and how to utilize
these new features
Description and Assessment of Assignments
There are seven different programming assignments in this course, and students will have approximately
two weeks per assignment. Each assignment combines specific C++ skills with an industrial application of
C++. Students are expected to complete these programming assignments individually. Each assignment’s
instructions include a grading rubric for that assignment.
